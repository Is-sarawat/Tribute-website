                <h2>Missile Man Of Bharat</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b> (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 
                     2015, 
                    Shillong) Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the 
                    development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of 
                    India from 2002 to 2007.

                    Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of 
                    Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
                    (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was 
                    project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both 
                    designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the 
                    program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him 
                    the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first 
                    intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV- 
                    III and was launched in 1989.
